//! This module implements the lower MAC (LMAC).
//!
//! The LMAC's job is it to divide access to the medium between all interfaces.
//! This achieved, by allowing an interface to lock the channel, on which the stack operates. This
//! prevents the other interface from changing the channel. If both interfaces attempt to lock the
//! same channel, they'll both have the lock on the channel and neither can change it, without the
//! other unlocking the channel beforehand. This is done through the [LMacInterfaceControl::lock_channel]
//! and [LMacInterfaceControl::unlock_channel] APIs.
//!
//! The issue with this design is, that it makes scanning impossible, if the channel is already
//! locked by another interfaces. To fix this, off channel operations are implemented, which allow
//! an interface to request permission from the other interface to temporarily change the channel
//! and scanning mode. This request maybe granted or rejected, by the other interface. To request
//! an off channel operation, the [LMacInterfaceControl::begin_interface_off_channel_operation] API
//! can be used. If the other interface currently holds the channel lock, it will receive an [OffChannelRequest] from [LMacInterfaceControl::wait_for_off_channel_request].
//! Which can then be granted or rejected.
