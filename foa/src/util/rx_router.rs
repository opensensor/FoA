//! This module contains a utility for routing received frames inside an interface.
//!
//! The design of some interface implementations (see `foa_sta`) requires processing some frames in
//! the background task and others in the users task, when a certain operation is initiated through
//! the interface control. `foa_sta` uses this for connecting and scanning, since those can (in
//! theory) be initiated by the user and the background task.
//!
//! ## Basic Operation
//! The RX router has two queues, which are labeled foreground and background, and routes the frame
//! based on the currently active operation. The [RxRouter] struct has a generic parameter for the
//! operation, which should be an enum containing all the different operations supported by the
//! interface implementation. For the STA interface, this would currently be scanning or
//! connecting. By default all frames are routed to the background queue, which would usually
//! terminate in the background task. If an operation is started through the [RxRouterEndpoint] of
//! the foreground queue all frames, for which [RxRouterOperation::frame_relevant_for_operation]
//! returned `true`, will be routed to foreground queue. It is also possible to start an operation
//! through the [RxRouterEndpoint] of the background queue, although this doesn't influence
//! routing, since all otherwise unmatched frames go to the background queue, but instead prevents
//! starting an operation from the endpoint of the foreground queue.
//!
//! ## Usage
//! Since the [RxRouter], [RxRouterEndpoint] and [RxRouterInput] structs have two generic type
//! parameters, that are dependent on the interface implementation, it's recommended to define type
//! aliases for these, since it would be fairly cumbersome to have the generics in the entire code
//! base.
//!
//! When using this in an interface implementation, the [RxRouter] struct should be placed in the
//! resources struct for the interface and [RxRouter::split] called on initialization. The returned
//! [RxRouterInput] should then be used by the part of the code handling RX, where
//! [RxRouterInput::route_frame] can be used to route the frame provided to the correct queue
//! depending on the currently active operation. The [RxRouterEndpoint]s should be passed to the
//! entity handling foreground operations (usually user control) and the background task, where
//! they can be used to receive frames and start operations with
//! [RxRouterEndpoint::start_operation]. The returned [RxRouterScopedOperation]
//! auto-terminates, when it's dropped.
//!
//! ### Important Note:
//! If at all possible, data frames should be processed before passing through the RX router,
//! unless they are strictly related to an operation. This is due to the RX router introducing
//! extra latency, since the frames have to pass through one more queue than strictly necessary,
//! which is acceptable for management frames but not data frames carrying actual MSDUs.
