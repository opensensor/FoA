#![no_std]
#![deny(missing_docs)]
//! This crate implements a station (STA) interface for FoA.
//!
//! ## Usage
//! To initialize a STA interface, call [new_sta_interface] with a [VirtualInterface] you got from
//! calling [foa::init], a mutable reference to [StaResources] and optionally a [MACAddress].
//! In return, you'll get a `(StaControl, StaRunner, StaNetDevice)`. For the stack to work, you
//! have to call [StaRunner::run], either in a separate task or by joining the future with another
//! one. Once you have done that, you can use the [StaControl] to control the interface, and pass
//! the [StaNetDevice] to [embassy_net].
//! ## Status
//! Currently only very basic operations are supported and much of this is work in progress. More
//! operations will follow in the future.
//!
//! ### Supported operations.
//! 1. Passive scanning
//! 2. Connecting to a network.
//!     - Both Open and WPA2-PSK encrypted networks
//! 3. Disconnecting from a network.
//! 4. Setting the MAC address.
//!
//! ## A note about the WPA2 implementation
//! `foa_sta` has an implementation of WPA2-PSK, which allows it to connect to networks using that
//! cipher suite. It is however extremely basic and in very early stages of development. This means
//! that it may crash at any point during the connection process and is not very secure. Most of
//! this is down to the way it is written, which was intended to get it working and figure out how
//! to do this at all. A new design using a state machine is already in the works, but it will take
//! some time to be ready.
//!
//! (Frostie314159): The reason this will take a while is, because I worked on WPA2 for two months
//! straight to get it working and sorta need to take my mind of it for a while.
